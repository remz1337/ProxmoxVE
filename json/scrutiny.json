    "description": "Scrutiny is a web-based tool for monitoring hard drive health using S.M.A.R.T metrics. It integrates with smartd to detect all connected hard drives, track their historical S.M.A.R.T data, and set customized thresholds based on real-world failure rates. It offers a web UI for easy monitoring and can send failure notifications via various services. Scrutiny aims to predict drive failures and ensure data safety through proactive monitoring and alerting.",
